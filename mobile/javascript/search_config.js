This meant one time use plastic water bottles would no longer be sold in vending machines or at\nany on-campus store. The college added water refill stations though out campus and starting selling retail style, reusable water bottles on campus. To encourage students to use these bottles and to kick\noff their campaign, the association gave one roll up water bottle to every student on campus. The water bottle was packaged with a message on the front about how many plastic disposable water bottles they would be eliminating each week, on the back of the packaging the 2015 Football schedule was printed.\n","VB5003\nPATROL SUNGLASSES\n53⁄8” x 21⁄16” x 1”\nImprint: Print\n(1 color/location included) Multiple color imprint: Yes Multiple locations: Yes Imprint area: 5⁄8” x 1⁄8”\nMaterial: Plastic, Steel Packaging: Polybag Qty/Wt Ctn: 300/19 lbs.\n• Aviator Style Sunglasses\n• Durable Steel Construction\n• Nose Pads\n• UV 400 Lenses\n• 100% UVA and UVB Protection\n100  4.08 250  3.64 500  3.25\n1000  2.90 2500  2.59\n(c)\nVB5003S\nOPTION\nGC1451-MFI\nMICRO USB LIGHTNING ADAPTER\nGC1562 CHARGING ESSENTIALS\nMOBILE POWER SET 33⁄8” x 7” x 1”\nImprint: Print\n(1 color/location on pouch, cable & power bank included) Imprint area: Varies by item Setup: $105.00(g)\nMaterial: ABS Plastic, Microfiber Packaging: Bulk Packaging Qty/Wt Ctn: 150/39 lbs.\n• Mobile Power Set\n• 2000 mAh Power Bank\n• Colored Wrist Strap\n• Input: 5V / 500 mA,\nOutput: 5V / 1000 mA\n• UL® Certified, BC & FCC\nVOC Certified / UL Files (MH61216-(XG Series))\n• Charger Cable Set with\nStandard USB, 2 Micro USB, Mini USB\n• Integrated Carabiner Clip\nGC1562N GC1562G GC1562R GC1562B\n50 14.45 100 13.95 250 13.45 500 12.95\n(c)\nGC1451 MFI\nFrom: 10.95 (c)\n13\n","KW1402\n17 OZ.
